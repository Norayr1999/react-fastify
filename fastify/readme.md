This is a simple fastify server which uses postgres as database and typeorm for interacting with db,

At first run 'npm install' to install dependencies then run 'npm run build' command to compile typescript code and then run 'npm start' to run the server.

You need to create .env file using .env.example and provide your credentials.

When server runs it automatically adds 4 users to db so you can test the endpoint.
